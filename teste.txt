/--e) Write a program in CD19 that will compute the area of a polygon from a set of (x, y)
Cartesian points. (1)
The program should have functions to (i) input the number of points (up to 20) and the
points themselves, and (ii) compute the area of the polygon.
The main program should be used to output the result.
