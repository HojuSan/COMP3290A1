Hello Dan

Hi Dan the feed back I recieved was this

1.Keywords & Idents - youre tokenising of 'FUNC' as TFUNC; the keyword is
'FUNCTION' (only knocked you 3 marks as this was the subject of a spec
revision a month ago); 'func' should be tokenised as "TIDNT func". 

2.Delimiters& Ops are Good, Numerics & Strings are Good, Errors are good, Comments are
handled properly. Your output does not pad each token (and token data) to
multiples of 6, as per spec, thus the output does not line up as expected.

3.Strings are not printed as Strings (should be printed within Quotation
marks). 

4.'TUNDF' should be printed on it own line.

I believe I have addressed each of these issues.
1. func was changed to function inside token.java
2. padding was added into the scanner debugPrint function
3. Strings now print with "" marks
4. TUNDF errors print on a new line
